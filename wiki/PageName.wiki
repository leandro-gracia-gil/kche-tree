#summary Code re-design, preserving original insight.
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

For the sake of code maintenance and clarity, we have decided to refactor the whole thing. We intend to make use of design patterns where necessary. This shall improve reusability. 


= Details =

After reviewing the code due to maintenance and support tasks, we believe that it would be valuable to put some effort reviewing some design concepts of the library. 
 
  * KD-Trees for classification purposes.
  * Greather modularity and more unit-testing.
  * Autoconf.

We are planning to incluse some UML class diagrams, in the documentation.

That said, it is important to keep in mind that we intend to preserve
original insight provided by original author.
