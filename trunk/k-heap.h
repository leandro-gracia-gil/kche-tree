 * \brief Define a reference-based heap that holds the K best elements on it allowing to push them in logarithmic time.
 *
 * \note Even if asyntotically optimal it could be slower than \link k_vector k-vectors\endlink for small values of K due to extra operations and cache misses.
 *
 * \tparam T Type of the data stored in the k-heap.
 * \tparam Compare Type of the comparison object. The class must inherit from \c std::binary_function an define its \c bool (\c const \c &T, \c const \c &T) \c const operator.
 * \tparam idx Type used for encoding data vector indices. Defaults to unsigned int, but can be reduced to short or char for small K values.
