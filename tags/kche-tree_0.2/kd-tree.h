/**
 * \mainpage Kche-tree Template Documentation
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 * Kche-tree is a template for generic cache-aware and non-mutable kd-trees.
 * Its main purpose is to provide an easy to use but powerful implementation
 * of the typical kd-tree structure functionality with very low latencies.
 *
 * It provides the following basic operations:
 * - \link kd_tree::build Build\endlink: create a kd-tree from a training set of
 *   feature vectors. Median splitting is used to keep the tree balanced. Cost: O(n log² n).
 * - \link kd_tree::knn K nearest neighbours\endlink: retrieve the K nearest
 *   neighbours of a given feature vector. Estimated average cost: O(log K log n).
 * - \link kd_tree::all_in_range All neighbours within a range\endlink: retrieve all the
 *   neighbours inside a maximum distance radius from a given feature vector.
 *   Estimated average cost: O(log m log n) with \e m the number of neighbours in the range.
 *
 * The template has been designed to minimize the number of cache misses combined
 * with many algorithmic techniques and ideas.\n
 * Here are some of its features:
 * - Incremental calculation of the hyperrectangle-hypersphere intersections.
 * - Internal data permutation to increase cache hits.
 * - Contiguous bucket data to reduce the leaf node size.
 * - Preorder memory allocation during the build to increase cache hits when traversing.
 * - Exploration/intersection recursive scheme to reduce the number of calculations performed.
 * - Use of specific k-neighbours optimized containers: k-vectors and k-heaps.
 * - Distance calculations with upper bounds allowing early returns.
 * - Designed to easily enable SSE optimizations by template specialization. Example and benchmarks included.
 * - Binary file format and stream operators provide to easily save and load the kd-trees.
 *
 * The current version is not still thread-safe. This is expected to be solved in future releases
 * along with OpenMP optimizations.
 *
 * Additionally, the following tools are provided:
 * - Example tool: shows a quite simple use of the template. Can be found in file example.cpp.
 * - Testing tool: tests the correction of the results and the I/O functions of the kd-tree.
 *   Comes in various flavors: random feature vector generation or file input and SSE optimizations.
 *   Can be found in file test_kdtree.cpp.
 * - Benchmark tool: measures the time spent in building the kd-tree and finding the K nearest neighbours.
 *   Like the testing tool comes in various flavors allowing to test its speed with random or
 *   preprocessed data from a file. Can be found in file speed_kdtree.cpp.
 *
 *
 * \section installation Usage
 * Kche-trees are quite simple to use. Just include the \c kd-tree.h file
 * and proceed like in the usage example \c example.cpp. Since it's a template
 * no additional files required to be compiled or linked. However it requires
 * the following files to be present where the main header is:
 * - kd-tree template files: kd-tree.h, kd-tree.cpp, kd-tree_io.cpp
 * - feature vector files: feature_vector.h, feature_vector.cpp
 * - k-neighbour container files: k-vector.h, k-vector.cpp for k-vectors,
 *   k-heap.h, k-heap.cpp, indirect_heap.h, indirect_heap.cpp for k-heaps.
 * - <b>LICENSE</b>: don't forget this is GPL code. Yours must be also if you use this.
 *
 * In case of using the floating point/24 dimension SSE specialization,
 * the file kd-tree_sse_24d.h and the compilation flag \c -msse will be required.
