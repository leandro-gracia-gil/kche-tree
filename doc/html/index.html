Introduction</h2>
<p>Kche-tree is a template for generic cache-aware and non-mutable kd-trees. Its main purpose is to provide an easy to use but powerful implementation of the typical kd-tree structure functionality with very low latencies.</p>
<p>It provides the following basic operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classkche__tree_1_1KDTree.html#a51d04c499016f902fde5afabb65d8b0a">Build</a>: create a kd-tree from a training set of feature vectors. Median splitting is used to keep the tree balanced. Cost: O(n logÂ² n).</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classkche__tree_1_1KDTree.html#ad3107a1ae40a3ab492621ae18c4c64d0">K nearest neighbours</a>: retrieve the K nearest neighbours of a given feature vector. Estimated average cost: O(log K log n).</li>
<li><a class="el" href="classkche__tree_1_1KDTree.html#a626ca00dc85218fd9b507a8a286843c8">All neighbours within a range</a>: retrieve all the neighbours inside a maximum distance radius from a given feature vector. Estimated average cost: O(log m log n) with <em>m</em> the number of neighbours in the range.</li>
</ul>
<p>The template has been designed to minimize the number of cache misses combined with many algorithmic techniques and ideas.<br/>
 Here are some of its features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incremental calculation of the hyperrectangle-hypersphere intersections.</li>
<li>Internal data permutation to increase cache hits.</li>
<li>Contiguous bucket data to reduce the leaf node size.</li>
<li>Preorder memory allocation during the build to increase cache hits when traversing.</li>
<li>Exploration/intersection recursive scheme to reduce the number of calculations performed.</li>
<li>Use of specific k-neighbours optimized containers: k-vectors and k-heaps.</li>
<li>Distance calculations with upper bounds allowing early returns.</li>
<li>Designed to easily enable SSE optimizations by template specialization. Example and benchmarks included.</li>
<li>Binary file format and stream operators provide to easily save and load the kd-trees and data sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current version is not still thread-safe. This is expected to be solved in future releases along with OpenMP optimizations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following tools and examples are provided:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Verify tool</b>: verifies the correction of the results provided by Kche-tree compared with a raw exhaustive search. Can be found in the file tools/verify.cpp. Comes with an extra SSE-optimized version.</li>
<li><b>Benchmark tool</b>: measures the time spent in building the kd-tree and finding the K nearest neighbours. Can be found in file speed_kdtree.cpp. Like the testing tool it also comes comes with an extra SSE-optimized version.</li>
<li><b>knn simple example</b>: shows a quite simple use of the template. Can be found in the file examples/knn_simple.cpp.</li>
<li><b>custom types example</b>: shows how to use a custom type with Kche-tree. Can be found in the file examples/custom_type.cpp.</li>
</ul>

Usage</h2>
<p>Kche-trees are quite simple to use. Just include the <code><a class="el" href="kche-tree_8h.html" title="Main kche-tree library header.">kche-tree.h</a></code> file, use its namespace like you would normally do with STL and proceed like in the usage example <code>knn_simple.cpp</code>. Since it's a template no additional files required to be compiled or linked. However it requires the <code>kche-tree</code> folder to be present in an include path. This can also be achieved by running <code>make</code> <code>install</code>, will copy the template files to your /usr/include folder by default. To undo this run <code>make</code> <code>uninstall</code>.</p>
<p>In case of using the floating point/24 dimension SSE specialization, the file tools/kd-tree_sse_24d.h and the compilation flag <code>-msse</code> (in GCC) will be also required. </p>
